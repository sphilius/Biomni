# Features for a Biomechanical Engineering & Exoskeleton/Prosthetic Control Agent

This document outlines 10 potential features for an AI agent focused on biomechanical engineering, specifically for neuromuscular model-based exoskeleton/prosthetic controllers and inverse kinematics, leveraging tools like Blender, OpenSim, OpenCap, and OpenSCAD/ActCAD.

## Brainstormed Features:

1.  **Automated OpenSim Model Personalization from OpenCap Data:**
    *   **Description:** User provides OpenCap motion capture data (marker trajectories, videos). The agent uses this data to automatically scale an existing generic OpenSim musculoskeletal model (e.g., Gait2392) to match the subject's anthropometry. This includes adjusting segment lengths, mass properties, and marker placements on the virtual model.
    *   **Tools:** OpenCap (input), OpenSim API (scaling, marker registration), Python scripting.
    *   **Output:** A personalized OpenSim model (`.osim` file) and a report on scaling accuracy.

2.  **Inverse Kinematics & Dynamics Pipeline with Control Objective Optimization:**
    *   **Description:** Given a personalized OpenSim model and motion data (from OpenCap or IMUs), the agent performs inverse kinematics (IK) to calculate joint angles and inverse dynamics (ID) to calculate joint moments. It then allows users to define control objectives (e.g., "minimize metabolic cost while maintaining balance and achieving target gait speed") and suggests exoskeleton/prosthetic control parameters (e.g., torque profiles, impedance settings) to achieve these.
    *   **Tools:** OpenSim API (IK, ID, RRA, CMC if applicable), optimization libraries (e.g., SciPy, CasADi), Python.
    *   **Output:** IK results (`.mot` file), ID results (`.sto` file), optimized control parameters, simulation results of the controlled motion.

3.  **Parametric Exoskeleton/Prosthetic Design Generator (OpenSCAD/ActCAD & Blender):**
    *   **Description:** User specifies design constraints (e.g., limb segment, desired range of motion assistance, material properties, target user anthropometry). The agent generates parametric 3D models of exoskeleton components or prosthetic sockets using OpenSCAD/ActCAD. These can then be imported into Blender for visualization, fit checking against a human model, and basic FEA stress analysis preparation.
    *   **Tools:** OpenSCAD/ActCAD scripting, Blender Python API, Python.
    *   **Output:** `.scad` or CAD files, `.blend` file with imported model, basic stress analysis report.

4.  **Neuromuscular Model-Based Exoskeleton Controller Tuning:**
    *   **Description:** User provides an OpenSim model with muscle actuators and an exoskeleton model. The agent helps tune parameters of a neuromuscular controller (e.g., a controller that uses simulated muscle states or EMG signals to command the exoskeleton). This involves running forward dynamics simulations with the exoskeleton assisting the model, and optimizing controller gains to achieve desired movement patterns or reduce muscle effort.
    *   **Tools:** OpenSim API (Forward Dynamics, Computed Muscle Control), control theory libraries, optimization libraries, Python.
    *   **Output:** Tuned controller parameters, simulation results (joint kinematics, muscle activations, GRFs with and without assistance).

5.  **Virtual Range of Motion (ROM) & Clash Detection for Custom Devices:**
    *   **Description:** Given a 3D model of a human limb (e.g., from a scan or parametric model) and a CAD model of an exoskeleton/prosthetic, the agent simulates the limb's range of motion with the device attached. It identifies clashes between the device and the body, or between device components, and calculates the effective ROM.
    *   **Tools:** Blender Python API (rigging, animation, collision detection), OpenSCAD/ActCAD (if device is parametric).
    *   **Output:** Animated visualization of ROM, clash report with locations, effective ROM values.

6.  **Gait Analysis & Exoskeleton Efficacy Reporter:**
    *   **Description:** User provides pre-intervention and post-intervention gait data (e.g., from OpenCap, force plates, IMUs) for a subject using an exoskeleton. The agent processes this data to calculate key gait parameters (stride length, speed, joint angles, moments, symmetry) and generates a report comparing the gaits, quantifying the exoskeleton's effect.
    *   **Tools:** OpenSim API (IK, ID), signal processing libraries (SciPy), plotting libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Python.
    *   **Output:** Comparative gait analysis report with plots and statistical summaries.

7.  **Real-time EMG-to-Torque Mapping Calibrator for Prosthetics:**
    *   **Description:** For a myoelectric prosthetic, the user performs a series of calibration movements while EMG data and (optionally) prosthetic joint angles/torques are recorded. The agent analyzes this data to build and calibrate a mapping (e.g., using machine learning models) from EMG signals to desired prosthetic joint torques.
    *   **Tools:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML models), signal processing libraries, Python.
    *   **Output:** Calibrated EMG-to-torque model, performance metrics (e.g., R^2 on a test set).

8.  **Human-Exoskeleton Interaction Force/Pressure Estimator:**
    *   **Description:** Based on an OpenSim model performing a task with an exoskeleton, and an STL/CAD model of the exoskeleton cuffs/straps, estimate the interaction forces and pressures at the human-device interface. This could involve simplified FEA or contact modeling.
    *   **Tools:** OpenSim API (for body dynamics), Blender (for geometry and potentially basic contact simulation), FEA software API (if available, e.g., CalculiX, or simplified Python-based contact mechanics).
    *   **Output:** Heatmap of pressure distribution on cuffs, peak force values, areas of high pressure.

9.  **Predictive Simulation of Movement with Novel Prosthetic/Exoskeleton Designs:**
    *   **Description:** User defines a novel prosthetic or exoskeleton concept (kinematics, actuator properties). The agent integrates this into an OpenSim model and uses predictive simulation (e.g., Moco) to forecast how a human might move with this device to perform a specific task (e.g., walking, sit-to-stand).
    *   **Tools:** OpenSim Moco, CasADi, Python.
    *   **Output:** Simulated movement trajectories, muscle activity patterns, metabolic cost estimates.

10. **Automated Test Bench Script Generator for Hardware Prototypes:**
    *   **Description:** After virtual prototyping, the user defines test procedures for a 3D-printed exoskeleton/prosthetic component (e.g., "cycle actuator from angle A to B for N cycles with load L"). The agent generates control scripts (e.g., Python scripts for Arduino/Raspberry Pi, G-code for CNC test rigs) to automate these hardware tests.
    *   **Tools:** Python (for script generation), knowledge of common microcontroller APIs.
    *   **Output:** Control scripts, test plan document.

## Analysis of Biomni Repo for Biomechanical Feature Suitability

Now, let's analyze the existing Biomni repository's suitability for these biomechanical features.

**Current Biomni Strengths Relevant to Biomech:**

*   **Agent Architecture (`A1.py`):** The core agent architecture (LLM for reasoning, tool execution, planning) is generalizable. It can learn to use new tools and follow complex instructions. This is a good foundation.
*   **Tool Integration Framework:**
    *   The system for defining tools via schemas (`biomni/tool_description/`) and dynamically creating Langchain tools (`biomni/utils.py::api_schema_to_langchain_tool`) is powerful. This would allow integration of Python APIs for OpenSim, Blender, OpenSCAD, etc.
    *   The ability to execute Python code, R scripts, and Bash commands (`run_python_repl`, `run_r_code`, `run_bash_script`) is essential, as many biomechanics tools are scriptable or have CLIs.
*   **Data Handling Concepts:** The idea of a `data_lake` and methods to add custom data (`A1.add_data`) could be adapted for biomechanical data (motion capture files, model files, EMG data).
*   **LLM for Complex Instructions:** Biomechanical analysis often involves multi-step workflows. An LLM could interpret natural language requests like "Personalize the Gait2392 model using this OpenCap data, then run IK and ID for the walking trial."
*   **Existing Tool Categories:** While not directly biomechanical, categories like `genomics` and `pharmacology` show the system's capacity to handle specialized scientific domains. A `biomechanics` or `musculoskeletal_modeling` tool category would fit naturally.
*   **Environment Management (`biomni_env/`):** The existing Conda/R environment setup demonstrates the ability to manage complex dependencies, which will be crucial for biomechanics software (OpenSim often has specific Python version needs, Blender has its own Python environment).

**Challenges and Required Adaptations/Extensions:**

1.  **New Tool Implementations (Major Effort):**
    *   **Core Need:** The biggest task would be developing a comprehensive suite of Python tools that wrap the functionalities of OpenSim, Blender, OpenCap, OpenSCAD/ActCAD.
        *   **OpenSim:** Functions for loading models, scaling, IK, ID, RRA, CMC, Forward Dynamics, Moco. This requires deep familiarity with the OpenSim Python API.
        *   **Blender:** Functions for importing/exporting CAD/STL, rigging, animation, collision detection, running Python scripts within Blender's context.
        *   **OpenCap:** Functions to parse OpenCap output, extract marker data, and potentially interact with its API if available.
        *   **OpenSCAD/ActCAD:** Functions to generate `.scad` scripts or interact with ActCAD if it has a Python API or CLI.
    *   These tools would need corresponding schema definitions in `biomni/tool/tool_description/`.

2.  **Environment Expansion:**
    *   The Conda environment (`biomni_env/environment.yml`) would need to include Python bindings for OpenSim, Blender (if run as a module, or manage its separate Python), OpenSCAD (if it has Python bindings), and any other necessary libraries (e.g., `pyNastran` for STL, `trimesh`, `numpy-stl`, `casadi`, `scikit-learn`).
    *   Installation of OpenSim, Blender, OpenSCAD/ActCAD themselves, and ensuring they are on the system PATH or accessible to the agent's execution environment. This might be complex, especially within a single container or environment.

3.  **Handling Large Binary Files & 3D Data:**
    *   Biomechanical data often involves large files (C3D, TRC, STO, OSim models, STL/CAD files). The current agent's data handling might need enhancements for efficient management, transfer, and versioning of these.
    *   Visualizing 3D data (models, motion) is key. While the agent itself won't render, it needs to output files in formats that visualization tools can consume, or generate scripts for tools like Blender to create visualizations.

4.  **Interactive/Iterative Workflows:**
    *   Many biomechanical tasks are iterative (e.g., tweaking model markers, re-running IK, adjusting controller parameters). The agent's planning and interaction model would need to support this iterative refinement effectively. The current checklist-style planning in `A1.py` could be adapted.

5.  **State Management for Complex Models:**
    *   An OpenSim model, for instance, is a complex stateful object. Tools would need to load, modify, and save these models, passing model file paths or serialized states between steps. The agent needs to manage these references.

6.  **Computational Intensity:**
    *   Simulations (Forward Dynamics, Moco), optimizations, and some IK/ID tasks can be computationally intensive. The `run_with_timeout` utility is good, but for longer tasks, a proper job management/queuing system might be needed if Biomni were deployed as a multi-user service. For a single-user agent, clear feedback on progress is important.

7.  **LLM Knowledge of Biomechanics:**
    *   The LLM's ability to understand biomechanical concepts, interpret user requests accurately, and generate correct sequences of tool calls will be crucial. This might require fine-tuning or very detailed system prompts and tool descriptions.

**Feasibility Assessment:**

*   **Core Agent Framework:** Suitable. The existing Biomni architecture provides a strong starting point for an AI agent that can understand tasks and use tools.
*   **Tooling Ecosystem:** Significant development effort required to build the biomechanical tools. This is the largest hurdle.
*   **Environment:** Achievable but complex. Containerization (as planned for the web UI) would be essential to manage the diverse software stack.
*   **Data Flow:** Manageable with extensions. The agent will need to be adept at handling file paths and ensuring tools have access to the correct input files.

**Conversion Path Suggestion:**

Instead of "converting" the entire Biomni repo, which is heavily geared towards molecular biology and genomics, a more practical approach would be:

1.  **Fork or Adapt:** Use the core agent logic from `A1.py` and the tool registration/execution mechanisms from `biomni/utils.py` as a foundation.
2.  **New Tool Category:** Create a new set of tool files (e.g., `biomni/tool/biomech_opensim.py`, `biomni/tool/biomech_blender.py`) and corresponding descriptions.
3.  **Specialized Environment:** Develop a new Conda environment file (`environment_biomech.yml`) or extend the existing one, focusing on biomechanical software.
4.  **Biomech-Specific Tasks:** Create new benchmark tasks in `biomni/task/` relevant to the features above.
5.  **Customized Agent (Optional):** Potentially create a `BiomechAgent` class inheriting from a common base (if refactored) or `A1`, with system prompts and default configurations tailored for biomechanics.

**Conclusion on Suitability:**

The Biomni repository provides a **good architectural blueprint** for building a biomechanical AI agent. Its strengths in agent-LLM interaction, extensible tool use, and code execution are highly relevant. However, applying it to the biomechanical features listed would require a **substantial investment in developing a new suite of specialized tools and expanding the software environment significantly.** It's less a "conversion" and more an "extension" or "adaptation" to a new scientific domain, leveraging the core patterns established by Biomni.

The most feasible first steps would be to implement wrappers for one or two key functionalities (e.g., OpenSim IK, basic Blender import/visualization) to prove the concept within the Biomni framework.
